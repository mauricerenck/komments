# Webmentions

## Receiving webmentions

**To receive webmentions you have to install the [IndieConnector plugin](https://github.com/mauricerenck/indieConnector) and configure it.** IndieConnector will handle all the webmentions and normalize their data. Currently only webmention.io is supported. After installing IndieConnector, Komment will automatically be informed about new webmentions.

**Webmention support is enabled by default but won't work until you install IndieConnector.**

## **DEPRECATED** Sending Webmentions Toots and archive.org pings 

The first version of the Komments plugin allowed sending webmentions and mastodon toots when publishing a page. This is deprecated by now!. Please use the [IndieConnector plugin](https://github.com/mauricerenck/indieConnector) for that!

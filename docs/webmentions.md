# Webmentions

## Receiving webmentions

**To receive webmentions you have to install the [IndieConnector plugin](https://github.com/mauricerenck/indieConnector) and configure it.** IndieConnector will handle all the webmentions and normalize their data. After installing IndieConnector, Komment will automatically be informed about new webmentions.

**Webmention support is enabled by default but won't work until you install IndieConnector.**
